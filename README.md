## How It's Made:
Tech used: EJS, Express.JS, NodeJS, Passport.JS & MongoDB

This is a CRUD application that leverages NodeJS with Express to operate the server. It uses Passport JS for managing the sessions once a user creates an account and logs in. The app utilizes MongoDB for storing the notes and the information for user authentication. I intended to make it simple whereby the user is able to add notes and delete them however I was able to add a functionality which enables a user to edit the note if they desire changes on it.

## Optimizations
I managed to make the app secure and each user has their information protected

### Lessons Learned:
Complex working apps come in simple packages!
